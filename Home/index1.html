            <h1>What is a Student Managment System</h1>
            <p>A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education sector establishments used to manage student data. It integrates students, parents, teachers and the administration. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts of academic achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student schedules; tracking student attendance; generating reports and managing other student-related data needs in an educational institution.
    
                Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers.[1] </p>

            <h1>Education management</h1>
            <p>Education management information systems (EMIS) aim to collect, integrate, process, maintain and disseminate data and information to support decision-making, policy-analysis and formulation, planning, monitoring and management at all levels of an education system. It is a system of people, technology, models, methods, processes, procedures, rules, and regulations that function together to provide education leaders, decision-makers and managers at all levels with a comprehensive, integrated set of relevant, reliable, unambiguous and timely data and information to support them in completion of their responsibilities.[1]
    
                The adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 4 (“Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”) as the new international education agenda also exerts more complex data demands on EMIS. Its emphasis on equity and inclusion, lifelong learning, and the need to measure learning outcomes have expanded the range of data that EMIS need to collect and manage.[2]
                
                Education management information systems only captures information on children who are (or have been) included in the school system. Even the most robust EMIS is unlikely to provide complete (or even any) information on children who have never been included and those who drop out. Robust education planning and policy therefore requires inputs from a broader set of data sources, including from household surveys. </p>
