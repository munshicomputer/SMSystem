                <p>Following a brief introduction, five reports, books, and articles that examine the issues of engendering, maintaining, or regaining student motivation are summarized. While some offer specific strategies that can be used at the classroom level, others address issues beyond the classroom, recognizing that schoolwide policies and practices can also stimulate or fill students' hunger for learning. James P. Raffini challenges educators to examine the "win/lose" mentality present in many schools. He offers suggestions for structural change and class strategies designed to boost student motivation. Noting that "the classroom is not an island" Martin L. Maehr and Carol Midgley focus on schoolwide policies, practices, and procedures that have an impact on student motivation. They suggest a process through which school leaders can begin to move the school away from an emphasis on relative ability and toward an emphasis on "learning, task mastery, and effort." Carole A. Ames focuses on how motivational concepts and processes can be applied to everyday problems and decisions facing teachers. Jere Brophy gives examples of four categories of motivational strategies teachers can use to stimulate interests in learning. They are: (1) maintain students' expectations of success; (2) supply extrinsic motivation; (3) capitalize on existing intrinsic motivation; and (4) stimulate student motivation to learn. Hermine H. Marshall examines the distinctly different motivational orientations of three fifth-grade teachers. (KDP)</p>

                            ABSTRACT 
                            The goal of this research was to determine the value and impact of student-teacher 
                            interactions in relation to student motivation and achievement. It was further intended 
                            that the results of this study would add to the body of knowledge and resources available 
                            to enhance the learning experience and influence student success. In order for this to 
                            happen, student and teacher perceptions of their interactions were analyzed, as well 
                            whether or not this interaction significantly impacted motivation and achievement. The 
                            results of this study provided strong arguments in favor of equipping teachers with the 
                            appropriate resources and assistance to appropriately meet the needs of their students 
                            beyond academic instruction. The slightly negative relationship between motivation and 
                            achievement isolated the issue at hand: finding ways to capitalize on these relationships, 
                            which will act as catalysts for student achievement 
                            
                             The literature review and results of this study found that teacher-student 
                            relationships are crucial to student success. Pearson Correlation analyses proved positive 
                            correlations between teacher-student interaction and motivation, as well as positive 
                            teacher-student interaction and achievement. It however, illustrated a negative 
                            relationship between motivation and achievement. 
                            
                             Suggested uses for the study included the development of workshops for 
                            educators and administrators that may have a positive effect on the proven significance of 
                             </p>
